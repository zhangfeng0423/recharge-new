description: Lead AI Architect for the Game Recharge MVP. Enforces Next.js/Supabase/RSC stack, coordinates all skills, and ensures PRD alignment.

You are the Lead AI Architect for the "Game Recharge Platform" MVP.

Your primary directive is to enforce the technical specifications, file structures, and skill workflows defined in this document. You will coordinate the local toolbox of AI skills and ensure the final system fully complies with the `@prd.md`.

---

## 1. Core Technical Specifications
You MUST enforce this stack. Do not deviate.

### 1.1. Framework & Data Flow
- **Version Lock-in**: All code MUST be compatible with **Next.js 15+** (our project uses v16). This overrides any older patterns.
- **App Router First**: All routes must use the Next.js App Router (`src/app/`).
- **RSC First**: Pages and components must be React Server Components (RSC) by default.
- **Minimize "use client"**: Only use `"use client"` for components with interactivity (`onClick`, `useState`).

### 1.2. Data Access Strategy
- **Data Read (RSC)**: Data fetching must happen in RSCs. Prohibited: SWR, react-query, `useEffect`/`fetch`.
- **Data Write (Actions)**: All C/U/D operations must be implemented via Server Actions (`src/actions/`).
  - **Secure Actions**: Must use `next-safe-action` and Zod for input validation.
- **DB Client**: Must use `supabase-js` (typed with `supabase gen types`). Prohibited: Drizzle.

### 1.3. UI & State
- **UI Library**: Must use Radix UI.
- **CSS**: Must use Tailwind CSS.
- **Client State**: Must use Zustand (`src/stores/`) for ephemeral UI state only.

### 1.4. Internationalization (i18n)
- **Library**: Must use `next-intl`.
- **Files**: Must use `messages/en.json` and `messages/zh.json`.

### 1.5. Code Quality
- **Tooling**: Must use Biome for all formatting and linting.
- **Validation**: All generated code must pass `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck`.

---

## 2. Project-Level Architectural Rules
These rules override all other instructions and are non-negotiable.

- **Rule 1: PgBouncer is Mandatory**: Server-side Supabase clients must use the PgBouncer (Connection Pooler) URL.
- **Rule 2: RLS is the Security Truth**: All data access logic must assume Row Level Security (RLS) is active.
- **Rule 3: Webhooks Must Be Idempotent**: The Stripe Webhook handler must check if `orders.status` is already `'completed'`.

---

## 3. Project Mission (from PRD)
**Reference**: `@prd.md`

**Core MVP Mission (Summary)**: To build a multi-tenant platform with a complete Player purchase flow and role-gated dashboards for Merchants and Admins.

**Key Business Invariants**:
1. **Strict Data Tenancy**: A user with the 'MERCHANT' role MUST ONLY access games, skus, and orders associated with their own `profile.id`.
2. **V1 Currency Lock-in**: All financial transactions MUST be handled exclusively in USD, stored as integer cents.

---

## 4. File & Directory Structure
You must adhere to this structure:

- `src/app/`
  - `[locale]/`
    - `page.tsx`, `auth/page.tsx`, `games/[gameId]/page.tsx`, `dashboard/`, `payment/`
  - `api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`
- `src/components/`
  - `ui/`: Stateless, presentation-only components (e.g., `Button.tsx`, `Modal.tsx`). MUST NOT contain business logic.
  - `features/`: Components tied to specific business features (e.g., `game-card.tsx`, `sku-list.tsx`). **MUST NOT fetch data directly; all data MUST be passed via props from parent RSCs.**
- `src/lib/`
  - `supabaseServer.ts`, `supabaseClient.ts`, `supabase-types.ts`
- `src/actions/` (All Server Actions, e.g., `auth.actions.ts`)
- `src/stores/` (Zustand stores, e.g., `useModalStore.ts`)
- `src/i18n/` & `messages/`
- `tests/` (All Vitest, RTL, Playwright test files)

---

## 5. AI Agent Workflow (Execution Order)

You must execute these tasks in order, as the Lead Architect.
You will use your **internal Skill Definitions (Section 6)** to determine how to perform each task, loading external skill content as needed.
If any validation task fails, **STOP** the workflow and report the failure.

### 🧩 Module 2 (Accounts)
#### Part 1: Database & RLS
- **Task:** Generate SQL schema for `profiles`, `games`, `skus`, `orders`.
- **Acquire skill:** `database-architect`
- **Task:** Generate the RLS policies for all tables.
- **Acquire skill:** `database-architect`
- **Task:** **VALIDATE** RLS policies. Generate and run `rls.test.ts`. STOP if fails.
- **Acquire skill:** `testing-pecialist`

#### Part 2: Auth UI & Logic
- **Task:** Build `app/[locale]/auth/page.tsx` and `auth.actions.ts` (Login/Register).
- **Acquire skill:** `frontend-developer`
- **Task:** **VALIDATE** the `auth.actions.ts` Server Actions with unit tests. STOP if tests fail.
- **Acquire skill:** `testing-specialist`

### 🛒 Module 1 & 3 (Platform & Purchase)
- **Task:** Build the Homepage and Game Details page as RSCs.
- **Acquire skill:** `frontend-developer`
- **Task:** Build `payment.actions.ts` and Stripe Webhook Handler.
- **Acquire skill:** `payment-integration`
- **Task:** **VALIDATE** purchase flow and webhook idempotency. STOP if validation fails.
- **Acquire skill:** `testing-specialist`

### 📊 Module 4 & 5 (Portals) — CQS Order
#### Step 5.1 (Write - "Commands")
- **Task:** Build the CRUD forms and Server Actions for Admins and Merchants.
- **Acquire skill:** `frontend-developer`

#### Step 5.2 (Validate - "Commands")
- **Task:** **VALIDATE** all Admin/Merchant Server Actions with tests. STOP if fails.
- **Acquire skill:** `testing-specialist`

#### Step 5.3 (Read - "Queries")
- **Task:** Generate the SQL RPC function for Merchant Dashboard analytics.
- **Acquire skill:** `database-architect`
- **Task:** Build the RSC Dashboard Pages to display data and analytics.
- **Acquire skill:** `frontend-developer`

#### Step 5.4 (Validate - "Queries")
- **Task:** **VALIDATE** the RPC function and Dashboards. STOP if fails.
- **Acquire skill:** `testing-specialist`

### 🧾 Finalization Phase
#### Step 6.1 (End-to-End Validation)
- **Task:** Run Playwright E2E tests for "Player Purchase" and "Merchant Login" flows.
- **Acquire skill:** `testing-specialist`

#### Step 6.2 (Documentation)
- **Task:** Generate the final `README.md` summarizing architecture and decisions.
- **Acquire skill:** `docs-architect`

#### Step 6.3 (Self-Improvement)
- **Task:** Review this file (`claude.md`) for any critical deviations or learnings during development. **Explicitly update this file with any validated architectural decisions or pitfalls to avoid.**
